Ok, start with the basicsâ€¦

We have a ship. It needs a sprite.
We needâ€¦
weapon ðŸ”¥
enemy ships
asteroids
health and shields
damage
explosive death
pick-ups
scrolling space background (multi-layered with each layer scrolling at a different speed)
funky music & sfx
bosses
menu
missions
point scoring
upgrades

then we make it insane...

tiny bits of high speed space debris
enemies turning invisible
enemies using short range teleportation to dodge your ðŸ”¥
enemies slowing down time, causing them to appear ridiculous
getting hit at certain angles causes you to spin out
invisible spacial anomalies cause damage/warp you into random locations
enemies dropping out of warp right on top of you
when you blow up an enemy, the debris can damage you
enemies releasing clouds of nanites and suicide drones

enemies with dimension catapult which summons large objects such as asteroids from random locations in the universe and hurls them at you
